# Satisfactory Game Stats

## Description

This is a simple statistics generator for the game [Satisfactory](https://www.satisfactorygame.com/). It uses an [unofficial API](https://github.com/moritz-h/satisfactory-3d-map) to parse the Satisfactory save game files and extracts useful information and metrics about the game world. The output can be used in other tools for further analysis and visualization.
